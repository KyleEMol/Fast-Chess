A project that I made for my Exeter Maths Certificate final project, which was creating various artificial intelligences that are capable of playing chess in four spacial dimensions.
This included a mixture of hard-coded algorithms as well as a very rudimentary neural network made using NumPy and a few other basic modules. 
Due to time and knowledge constraints, the effectiveness of the neural network is very much ambiguous, however tournament results testing my various bots has been documented.
I don't know how much of it works, as I believe that this may have been neglected, but it's the latest version I have found, I've lost the actual final product.

If this interests you, I would recommend doing as little of what I did as possible, I may revisit this in the future as it's quite the passion project, but was done very inefficiently.
